# HTML Page Generation
Please generate an html page according to the content of {file_name.md}. Use HTML + Tailwind CSS to generate the interface and use the lucide icon component library to add icons to the interface. 
During the process, use highlight, block, flowchart and other style components to make the page more beautiful and easy to read. 
Use bold and highlighting to highlight the key content in the text. Please ensure that the highlighted color does not affect normal reading and aesthetics.
When introducing picture and video content, use border and add rounded corners and shadow effects.

Store the generated page under the path jaysean_share/public/img
