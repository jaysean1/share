# Styling Conventions

The website uses Tailwind CSS for styling with some custom extensions and plain CSS for specific animations and effects.

## Tailwind Configuration
The site uses Tailwind CSS via CDN with a custom configuration that extends the default theme:

```javascript
tailwind.config = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#2563eb',      // Primary blue color
        secondary: '#3b82f6'     // Secondary blue color
      },
      borderRadius: {
        // Custom border radius values
        'button': '4px'          // Special radius for buttons
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Custom CSS Classes
Several custom CSS classes are defined for specific effects:

- `.nav-link` - Navigation links with animated underline effect
- `.fade-in` - Elements that fade in when scrolled into view
- `.timeline-item` - Timeline styling for experience entries
- `.visible` - Applied to fade-in elements when they become visible

## Color Scheme
- Primary: `#2563eb` (Blue)
- Secondary: `#3b82f6` (Lighter blue)
- Text: Various grays (Gray-700, Gray-800, Gray-900)
- Background: White and Gray-50

## Animation Approach
Animations are implemented using a combination of:
1. CSS transitions for hover effects
2. Intersection Observer API in JavaScript for scroll-based animations
3. JavaScript for number counting animations

## Responsive Design
The design is responsive with:
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints at standard Tailwind sizes (sm, md, lg, xl)
- Different layouts for various screen sizes (stack on mobile, grid on larger screens)
